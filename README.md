[My personal web (jdonado.com)](https://www.jdonado.com/): with information about how I write software, an overview of my blog's contents, some of [my pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/79693661@N05/albums) and some of my [music tracks](https://fractalfields.bandcamp.com/). Although I wrote it in 2016, and I used tools back then that I wouldn't use today (Angular.js, for instance), I guess that it still serves its purpose ðŸ˜„.
